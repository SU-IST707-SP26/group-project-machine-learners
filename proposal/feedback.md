Very good!  This is a really interesting project.  I think your general approach is good - divide the report into sections first, then build assessments within category, and then regress on ESG score (do I have that right?).  

The only thing I'd add to this is that I want you to pick between your stakeholders, and really think carefully about what you are delivering to them.  If you are building something for the small / mid-size company that wants their own estimated ESG score, then you'll need to scaffold data entry to make sure these companies are providing the comprehensive inputs you need to calculate the score.  That doesn't necessarily mean you need to build an interface to collect that data, but you will at least need to build a spec that explains what the company needs to provide.

Note that in addition text based data, there is likely numeric and tabular data - have you given thought to how to incorporate that?  This will complicate your model.

Let me know if you need help, or if you think I've mis-interpreted things here.

SCORE: 5/5
