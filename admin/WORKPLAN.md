## Active Plan

### Milestone 1: Data Identification and Project Proposal
- [✅] M1.T1 — Find and Download Kaggle ESG dataset (Team)
- [✅] M1.T2 — Ensure SEC 10-K filing data can be retrieved through Python library (Ethan)
- [✅] M1.T4 — Complete and push proposal along with management docs (Ethan)

### Milestone 2: Data Verification and Quality Assessment
- [⏳] M2.T1 — Collect SEC 10-K files for companies in ESG dataset, must filter for temporal variable (Ethan)
- [ ] M2.T2 — Verify target feature(s) from ESG dataset and perform EDA to verify data assumptions (X)
